Manage project specific settings without polluting your project directory.

== Installation

* Most package managers

[,lua]
----
"saccarosium/projectconf.nvim"
----

* https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim[Lazy.nvim]

[,lua]
----
{ "saccarosium/projectconf.nvim", lazy = false }
----

== Configuration

The configuration is a table with the keys as the path to the project and the
value as either a function or a string.

NOTE: Environment variables and shortcuts (such as `~`) will be expanded. This
work also over on Windows

[,lua]
----
require("projectconf").setup({
  -- When your cwd is equal to home it will call this function
  ["$HOME"] = function()
    vim.opt_local.expandtab = false
    vim.cmd.colorscheme = "gruvbox"
  end,
  -- When your cwd is equal to xdg_config_home it will require
  -- the lua module with the name "work_project"
  ["$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/work_project"] = "work_project"
})
----

== Why

I needed a simple but yet effective way to have project specific modifications.
I've tried to use `:h exrc` but I found that, as a heavy `:h ftplugin` user, my
modification where overwritten by other events, since I believe `.nvim.lua` is
sourced only on `:h VIMENTER`. So I come up with this plugin that will maintain
your modification and will not pollute your project root directory.
